# Nursing-College-Admission-Assistant-Flow

This project showcases a fully designed conversational flow for an AI-powered chatbot that guides prospective students through the B.Sc Nursing admission process. Built as part of a prompt engineering assignment for LiaPlus AI, the chatbot handles eligibility checks, program details, fee structure, hostel/training info, scholarships, and moreâ€”with dynamic responses based on user input.
